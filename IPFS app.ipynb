    "“When you have IPFS, you can start looking at everything else in one specific way and you realize that you can replace it all” — Juan Benet\n",
    "\n",
    "### But first -- WTF is IPFS?\n",
    "\n",
    "IPFS is a peer-to-peer (p2p) filesharing protocol that aims to fundamentally change the way information is distributed across & beyond the globe. Yes, its as ambitious as HTTP. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Data Storage providers\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://www.maxcdn.com/one/media/interplanetary-file-system.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- IPFS synthezises great ideas from years of consists of communication protocol & distributed system research\n",
    "- A Communcation protocol is a set of rules that define how and when information is distributed \n",
    "- For example, the Internet protocol suite consists of 4 layers, each of which is responsible for specific functions. \n",
    "-  The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the current basis for communication on the Web\n",
    "-  Data is stored in centralized servers and accessed by location-based addressing. \n",
    "- This makes it easier to distribute, manage, secure the data, and to scale the capacity of both servers and clients. \n",
    "- But there are weaknesses to HTTP! \n",
    "- security (central point of failure) \n",
    "- privacy (control of sever means control of your data)\n",
    "- efficiency (location addressing means you have to go to all the way to a specific location to access a piece of data, even if that same data is available somewhere closer)\n",
    "- HTTP is great for loading websites but it wasn’t designed for the transfer of large amounts data \n",
    "- In the first two decades of the web, the size of the average web page has only increased from ~2 kilobytes to ~2 megabytes.\n",
    "- HTTP eats up lots of bandwidth, network hops cost money to data providers, downloads from a single computer instead of several simultatenously \n",

    "### Who is Behind IPFS?\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](http://blog.tadhack.com/wpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pl_projects.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The InterPlanetary File System — a tribute to J.C.R. Licklider’s vision for an “intergalactic” Internet — is the brainchild of Juan Benet, who moved to the U.S. from Mexico as a teen, earned a computer science degree at Stanford, started a company acquired by Yahoo! in 2013 and, last year at Y Combinator, founded Protocol Labs, which now drives the IPFS project and its modest aim of replacing protocols that have seemed like facts of life for the last 20 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPFS Stack \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/untitled-160314124602/95/data-structures-in-and-on-ipfs-28-638.jpg?cb=1457959668 \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- IPFS is a versioned file system that can take files and manage them and also store them somewhere and then tracks versions over time. \n",
    "- IPFS also accounts for how those files move across the network so it is also a distributed file system.\n",
    "- Versioning gives you the ability to track how states of software change over time (think Git).\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*vDF3h6bfp-Ir3F8g.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- IPFS has rules as to how data and content move around on the network that are similar in nature to bittorrent. \n",
    "- This file system layer offers very interesting properties such as:\n",
    "- websites that are completely distributed\n",
    "- websites that have no origin server\n",
    "- websites that can run entirely on client side browsers\n",
    "- websites that do not have any servers to talk to\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributed Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](http://slideplayer.com/4168557/13/images/8/Distributed+Hash+Table.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- A hash table is a data structure that stores information as key/value pairs. \n",
    "- In distributed hash tables (DHT) the data is spread across a network of computers, and efficiently coordinated to enable efficient access and lookup between nodes.\n",
    "- The main advantages of DHTs are in decentralization, fault tolerance and scalability. \n",
    "- Nodes do not require central coordination, the system can function reliably even when nodes fail or leave the network, and DHTs can scale to accommodate millions of nodes. \n",
    "- Together these features result in a system that is generally more resilient than client-server structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Block Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](http://cdn.oreilly.com/excerpts/9780596514433/w2dp_0307.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bittorrent is able to successfully coordinate the transfer of data between millions of nodes by relying on an innovative data exchange protocol, however it is limited to the torrent ecosystem. \n",
    "- IPFS implements a generalized version of this protocol called BitSwap, which operates as a marketplace for any type of data.\n",
    "- This marketplace is the basis for Filecoin: a p2p storage marketplace built on IPFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merkle DAG\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Hash_Tree.svg/1200px-Hash_Tree.svg.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- A merkle DAG is a blend of a Merkle Tree and a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). \n",
    "- Merkle trees ensure that data blocks exchanged on p2p networks are correct, undamaged and unaltered. \n",
    "- This verification is done by organizing data blocks using cryptographic hash functions. \n",
    "- This is simply a function that takes an input and calculates a unique alphanumeric string (hash) corresponding with that input. \n",
    "- It is easy to check that an input will result in a given hash, but incredibly difficult to guess the input from a hash.\n",
    "- The individual blocks of data are called ‘leaf nodes’, which are hashed to form ‘non-leaf nodes’. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](http://whatdoesthequantsay.com/assets/images/ipfs_objects_directory_structure.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- These non leaf nodes can then be combined and hashed, until all the data blocks can be represent by a single root hash.\n",
    "- A DAG is a way to model topological sequences of information that have no cycles.\n",
    "- A merkle DAG is basically a data structure where hashes are used to reference data blocks and objects in a DAG. \n",
    "- This creates several useful features: all content on IPFS can be uniquely identified, since each data block has a unique hash. Plus the data is tamper-resistant because to alter it would change the hash\n",
    "- Instead of referring to objects (pics, articles, videos) by which server they are stored on, IPFS refers to everything by the hash on the file\n",
    "- IPFS uses content addressing at the HTTP layer.\n",
    "- This means that the content is going to determine the address.\n",
    "- The mechanism is to take a file, hash it cryptographically so you end up with a very small and secure representation of the file which ensures that someone can not just come up with another file that has the same hash and use that as the address. \n",
    "\n",
    "In IPFS you separate the steps into two parts;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify the file with content addressing\n",
    "- Go and find it — when you have the hash then you ask the network you’re connected to ‘who has this content? (hash)’ and you connect to the corresponding nodes and download it.\n",
    "- The result is a peer to peer overlay that gives you very fast routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IPFS Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/LExEmDz.png\"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- IPFS is essentially a P2P system for retrieving and sharing IPFS objects. An IPFS object is a data structure with two fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data — a blob of unstructured binary data of size < 256 kB.\n",
    "- Links — an array of Link structures. These are links to other IPFS objects.\n",
    "- A Link structure has three data fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name — the name of the Link.\n",
    "- Hash — the hash of the linked IPFS object.\n",
    "- Size — the cumulative size of the linked IPFS object, including following its links.\n",
    "- The Size field is mainly used for optimizing the P2P networking and we’re going to mostly ignore it here, since conceptually it’s not needed for the logical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- IPFS objects are normally referred to by their Base58 encoded hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Version Control System \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Vk9w5CXlRdp4T10UTpEYXg.jpeg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another powerful feature of the Merkle DAG structure is that it allows you to build a distributed version control system (VCS). \n",
    "- The most popular example of this is Github, which allows developers to easily collaborate on projects simultaneously. \n",
    "- Files on Github are stored and versioned using a merkle DAG. \n",
    "- It allows users to independently duplicate and edit multiple versions of a file, store these versions and later merge edits with the original file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additionally, IPFS does not rely on access to Internet protocols. Data can be distributed in overlay networks, which are simply networks built on another network. \n",
    "- These features are notable, because they are core elements in for a censorship-resistant web. \n",
    "- It could be a useful tool in promoting free speech to counter the prevalence of internet censorship around the world, but we should also be cognizant of the potential for abuse by bad actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Self Certifying File System \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/untitled-160314124602/95/data-structures-in-and-on-ipfs-59-638.jpg?cb=1457959668 \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- The last essential component of IPFS we’ll cover is the Self-certifying File System (SFS). \n",
    "- It is a distributed file system that doesn’t require special permissions for data exchange. \n",
    "- It is “self-certifying” because data served to a client is authenticated by the file name (which which is signed by the server). \n",
    "- The result? You can securely access remote content with the transparency of local storage.\n",
    "- IPFS builds on this concept to create the InterPlanetary Name Space (IPNS). It is an SFS that uses public-key cryptography to self-certify objects published by users of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Some Interesting Projects being built with IPFS\n",
    "\n",
    "A few interesting projects being built on IPFS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Akasha, a Next-Generation social network\n",
    "\n",
    "- BlockFreight, an open network for global freight\n",
    "\n",
    "- Livepeer, a decentralized live-video streaming platform\n",
    "\n",
    "- Origin, a peer-to-peer marketplace for the sharing economy\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is also being used as a complementary file system for public blockchains and other p2p applications. \n",
    "- At the time of writing it can cost several dollars to store a kilobyte of data in an Ethereum smart contract. \n",
    "- This is a major constraint and there is currently massive growth in new decentralized apps (DApps) being launched. IPFS is interoperable with smart contracts and blockchain data, so it can add reliable, low-cost storage capacity to the ethereum ecosystem.\n",
    "- The attempt to make Ethereum blockchain data natively accessible on IPFS is a separate protocol known as IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data).\n",
